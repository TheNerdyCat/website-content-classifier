# Website Content Classifier
This project aims to predict, given some customer data, whether they will click on a specific website content (e.g. an advert or popup message). This is focussed on marketing, and uses could be in targeting specific customers based on their spending data, such as displaying the content that they are most likely to click on (according to the algorithms).

Problems I had with this project were that:
 - Not all customers have indefinitely had content shown to them (they haven't used certain pages on the website for example). This means lots of NAs.
 - People are much less likely to click on content, so the data were heavily imbalanced. And I mean HEAVILY.
